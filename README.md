# Camp-Vuiw

Camp-Vuiw is a web application built using Vue.js as a frontend, and Express, Node, and Mongoose for the backend. The purpose of the project is to practice building a full-stack web application from end to end, including frontend development, backend development, and database integration.

## Installation

To install Camp-Vuiw, you can clone the repository and install all the dependencies using npm:

```
git clone https://github.com/Cywus98213/Camp-Vuiw-vue-version.git
cd Camp-Vuiw
npm install
```

Note: This assumes that you have Node.js and npm already installed on your system.

## Usage

For the server side:

Generate dummy data by running the following command in the server directory:

```
cd server/
node seeds/seeds.js
```

To run the application, you can use the following command:

This will start the server and make the application available at http://localhost:3000.

```
npm start
```

For the client side:

To run the application, you can use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the server and make the application available at http://localhost:3000.

## Features

Camp-Vuiw currently supports the following features:

- Basic single-page routing
- RESTful API for adding, deleting, and updating data in the database
- Form validation using the VueValidate library

In the future, additional features may be added, such as user authentication and account validation.

## Known Issues

- The application may not be optimized for performance and may have some slow loading times or other performance issues.
- There may be some bugs or errors that have not yet been identified or fixed.
- As this is my first full-stack project, there is likely room for improvement in terms of best practices, coding standards, and overall quality of the code.

Please feel free to report any issues or bugs that you encounter while using the application.
