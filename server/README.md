# Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB Project

## Overview

This project is my first attempt at building a Node.js backend using the Mongoose library to interact with a MongoDB database. The purpose of this project is to learn about backend development and gain practical experience working with Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- JWT

## Features

### Some of the key features of this project include:

- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on a campground resource
- Mongoose schemas for defining the data structure of the campground resource and its associated reviews
- Middleware for handling errors and authentication
- Integration with MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database hosting
- Password hashing for secure user authentication
- file upload using third party resources

## Challenges Faced

### As a beginner in backend development, I faced a number of challenges while working on this project, including:

- Understanding the syntax and concepts of Node.js and Mongoose
- Learning how to work with MongoDB and its queries
- Implementing middleware for error handling and authentication
- Securing user data with password hashing
- Understanding the authentication and authorization requirements of the service
- Figuring out how to properly format the file data to be sent to the service
- Handling errors and edge cases that may arise during file upload
- Optimizing the upload process for performance and reliability
- Integrating the uploaded files into your application and storing the associated metadata.

## Solutions

To address these challenges, I focused on practicing and gaining practical experience working with Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. I also consulted online resources and documentation to learn about best practices and common techniques used in backend development. As a result, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how to build a RESTful API, work with databases, and implement middleware, cloud services for handling errors, authentication and files.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project has been a valuable learning experience for me as I continue to develop my skills in backend development. By working with Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB, and also trying different library and cloud services. I have gained a deeper understanding of how to build scalable and secure web applications. I look forward to continuing to learn and develop my skills in this area.
